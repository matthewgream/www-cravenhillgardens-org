<p>Craven Hill Gardens is on the doorstep of central London, being one of the worlds most visited locations. There are a number of sights in easy reach that are worth a visit, mostly accessible by foot. </p><h2>Sights in and around Craven Hill Gardens<a name="sights-nearchg" title="sights-nearchg"></a></h2> <p><img class="lpadding" src="/_assets/chg-sights-hempelgardens-360.jpg" border="0" alt="Hempel Hotel, Gardens" vspace="5" width="240" align="right" /><strong>The Hempel Hotel</strong> [<a href="http://www.the-hempel.co.uk">Link</a>] -- This famously discrete, minimalist and upmarket hotel was designed by Anouska Hempel and is frequented by the rich, famous and well known. It is host to high profile events, including parties during London fashion week, and camera crews -- most famously the wedding scene from the movie Notting Hill. The Hempel owns the main garden square. </p><p><strong>Corringham by Kenneth Frampton</strong> [<a href="http://www.corringham.eu">Link</a>] -- This modernist architectural gem was designed and built in the the 1960's and is now heritage listed. The apartments in this residental block have a unique internal arrangement, overlooking the only other green space within Craven Hill Gardens.</p><p><strong>False Fronts on Leinster Terrace</strong> [<a href="http://knowledgeoflondon.com/odds.html">Link</a>] -- When the underground was built in the area, the properties at 22 to 23 Leinster Terrace were purchased, demolished and the rear left open for ventilation. To maintain the facade, false fronts were built, nearly indistinguishable from the adjacent building fronts.</p><p><strong>London Underground Cavity</strong> -- The sound of a moving underground train can usually be traced to the ventilation shaft on the corner of Craven Hill and Craven Hill Gardens to the north east. It sits between a modern build and the pavement. </p><p><strong>London Toy and Model Museum</strong> [<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19981212030632/http://www.londontoy.com/">Link</a>] -- Sadly this museum is now closed, but it previously resided at 21 to 23 Craven Hill and was considered one of Europe's most extensive collections of commercially made toys and models from 1850 onwards.</p><p><strong>Historical plaques</strong> [<a href="/history#historical-plaques">Link</a>] -- Various historical plaques are located in or around Craven Hill Gardens. </p><p><strong>Filming locations</strong> [<a href="/history#filming-locations">Link</a>] -- Various films have been shot in or around Craven Hill Gardens.</p>  <h2>Sights within 10-15 minutes walk of Craven Hill Gardens<a name="sights-shortwalkchg" title="sights-shortwalkchg"></a></h2><p><strong>Cleveland Square and Gardens</strong> [<a href="http://www.clevelandsquare.org/">Link</a>] -- This prestigious block and its gardens are the location of yearly fireworks night, summer parties, movie shoots and a stately ambiance.

Already the construction facade is a head turner, with its oversized coloured pencils and book ends.  </p><p><strong>Inverness Court Hotel</strong> [<a href="http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/resources/theatres/show/2179-inverness-court-hotel">Link</a>] -- This ornate building is a former private house, remodelled, with its own theatre, for Louis Spitzel (d. 1906) by Mewes and Davis, architects of the Ritz.<br /><strong><br />Halepi Restaurant and Kebab House</strong> [<a href="http://www.halepi.co.uk/">Link</a>] -- This charming and informal Greek establishment has been in same same family since 1966 and once hailed as the best Greek restaurant in the world </p><p><strong>The Italian Garden and The Fountains</strong> [<a href="http://www.victorianweb.org/art/parks/11.html">Link</a>] -- The spectacular fountains, sculptures and the overall general arrangement make this a pleasant and well visited area of Kensington Gardens at the entrance opposite Lancaster Gate Underground. </p><p><strong>Bayswater Road and the Art Market</strong> [<a href="http://www.bayswater-road-artists.co.uk/">Link</a>] -- For nearly 50 years this transport artery opens up every Sunday to over 250 artists and craftsmen with their original works of art. Start at Queensway and head down to Lancaster Gate and beyond.  </p><p><strong>Paddington Station</strong> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Paddington_station">Link</a>] -- Isambard Kingdom Brunel's great creation of the mid 1800s, now one of London's key transport hubs for services to the west and Heathrow.  </p><p><strong>St Mary's Hospital (and Fleming Museum)</strong> [<a href="http://www.imperial.nhs.uk/aboutus/museumsandarchives/index.htm">Link</a>] -- Visitors can see Fleming's laboratory restored to its 1928 condition, and otherwise walk around one of the countries leading academic research centres, and birthplace to many over the years, including the Royals. </p><p><strong>Queensway </strong>[<a href="http://www.streetsensation.co.uk/queensway/qw_intro.htm">Link</a>] -- Ecclectic, yet increasingly gentrified, shopping street home to some of London's best Chinese Restaurants, and a variety of retail and dining. </p><p><strong>Whiteleys </strong>[<a href="http://www.whiteleys.com">Link</a>] -- William Whiteley's famous shopping centre, now brought into the modern age and increasingly moving up market. Pleasant shopping and dining experience. </p><p><strong>Hallfield Estate</strong> [<a href="http://www.casweb.org/hallfield">Link</a>] -- Sir Denys Lasdun's 800 flat estate provided housing the public, and it is easily forgotten that it was radical and inspirational at the time.  It is now a listing building.<br /><br /><strong>Craven Road, Hill and Terrace</strong> -- Nearby clustering of retail, restaurants and assortments of services at your disposal. Craven Hill has many fine villas, alas mostly infilled to the sides to make use of valuable real estate. </p><p><strong>Leinster Terrace, Queens Gardens, Chillworth Street and nearby Mews</strong> -- The local streets reveal the historic nature of the area, many buildings once home to stately characters, businesses or institutions, but largely now either housing or hotels. </p><h2>Sights over 10-15 minutes walk of Craven Hill Gardens<a name="sights-longwalk-chg" title="sights-longwalk-chg"></a></h2> <p><strong>Westbourne Grove</strong> [<a href="http://www.westbourne-grove.com/">Link</a> and <a href="http://www.streetsensation.co.uk/queensway/qw_intro.htm">Link</a>] -- One of London's most well known and visited shopping streets, stretching from the northern end of Queensway down through Chepstow Corner, Notting Hill and ultimately finishing at Portobello Road. Take the time on foot to stroll, shop and dine.</p><p><img class="rpadding" src="/_assets/chg-sights-portobelloroadmap-180.jpg" border="0" alt="Portobello Market" vspace="5" width="180" align="left" /><strong>Portobello Road </strong>[<a href="http://www.portobellovillage.com">Link</a>] -- Home to the famously weekly markets, full of antiques, works of art and bric-a-brac, leading down to fruit, veg and daily essentials.

Westbourne Grove. </p><p><strong>Connaught Village</strong> [<a href="http://www.connaughtvillage.com">Link</a>] -- A quaint and pleasant "village" in the heart of the city reminiscent of an older age with its boutiques, galleries, and restaurants. Be sure to walk there via. Westbourne Terrace, Bathurst Street and Hyde Park Square to nose around expensive yet obscure inner city living.  </p><p><strong>Paddington Basin</strong> [<a href="http://www.inpaddington.com/">Link</a>] -- This large redevelopment to the rear of Paddington Station has revitalised the area, and is worth a stroll, shop and dine, particularly on the way through to Little Venice. Walk down Eastbourne Terrace, and turn in to the left on Bishops Bridge. </p><p><strong>Little Venice</strong> [<a href="http://www.maidavalevillage.com/">Link</a>] -- The intersection of the canals at Warwick Crescent is one of inner London's most pleasant areas. From here, take a boat to Regents Park and Camden, head down to the Formosa Dining Room at Warwick Avenue, and admire the grand properties. Walk through via. Paddington Basin. </p><p><strong>Edgware Road</strong> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgware_Road,_London">Link</a>] -- Colourful, rough, and Middle Eastern in flavour, another of London's most well known and trafficed streets. Not really worth a stroll along, but certainly worth a drive through to understand the flavour of West London.  </p><p><strong>Marble Arch</strong> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble_Arch">Link</a>] -- Home to Speakers' Corner, a marble monument, and once the location of the notorious Tyburn gallows, but now a notorious traffic intersection. Worth a view when approached from Hyde Park. </p><p><strong>Hyde Park </strong>[<a href="http://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/hyde_park/">Link</a>] -- To the east of West Carriage drive, this park is certainly worth a day to stroll and dine, and if the weather is great, try taking out a boat onto the Serpentine. Don't miss the Diana Fountain, Speakers' Corner and Rotten Row. Just a short walk. </p><p><strong>Kensington Gardens</strong> [<a href="http://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/kensington_gardens/">Link</a>] -- To the west of West Carriage drive, start from Lancaster Gate with the Italian Gardens, The Fountains, then the Round Pond, Diana's Playground, Kensington Palace, The Albert Memorial and the Serpentine Gallery.
