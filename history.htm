<p>Craven Hill Gardens is steeped in modern history as a result of its central location, and much of this history has been documented and preserved.</p><h2>Historical Background<a name="historical-background" title="historical-background"></a></h2><p>For a detailed history of the Craven Hill Gardens area, see the <a href="http://www.corringham.eu/wateringplace.html">historical material</a> on the Corringham site or the <a href="http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22666">"Paddington: Bayswater"</a> section from "A History of the County of Middlesex". A summary of the former is: </p><blockquote><p>In 1733 William 3rd Baron Craven bought Upton Farm with its 9 acres of land in the common fields of Bayswater. He replaced the farm with a large house and accompanying grounds, ponds and buildings, the construction of which were permitted provided that in the event of another plague, the buildings would be converted to a hospital. This estate was passed as whole through the family until 1825 when it was divided amongst the heirs of William 7th Baron Craven. These parts were then variously developed and/or sold in tandem with the growth and development of the surrounding area, what was referred to as a "great aristocratic town" during the mid to late 1800's. During this period Whiteley's grew as a luxurious shopping destination (although the present building was not completed until 1911), and both Paddington Station and the Underground were introduced into the area.</p></blockquote>  <p>The numerous maps of the greater London area dating from the 1700s onwards show the transition over a period of 100 years. The majority of the area appears to have been built in the 1840s and 1850s. Compare the farmland of 1786 to the moderate buildings of the 1825 to the urban density of 1889.</p>   <blockquote><table border="0"><tbody>  <tr><td><img class="lpadding" src="/_assets/map-1786-the-evirons-of-london-cary-snip.jpg" border="0" alt="Extract from Cary's 'Actual Survey of the Country Fifteen Miles Around London' (1786)" vspace="5" width="300" align="right" />John Cary's <a href="http://www.oldlondonmaps.com/cary/carymain.html">"Actual Survey of the Country Fifteen Miles Around London"</a> was one of the first London maps, and <a href="http://www.oldlondonmaps.com/cary/cary24.html">"The area including Hampstead, Kensington, Paddington and Hammersmith in 1786"</a> indicates the location of Craven Hill.</td></tr>  <tr><td style="padding-top: 1em"><img class="lpadding" src="/_assets/map-1826-map-of-london-greenwood-snip.jpg" border="0" alt="Extract from Greenwood's 'Map of London ... from an Actual Survey' (1825)" vspace="5" width="300" align="right" />Christopher and John Greenwood's <a href="http://www.oldlondonmaps.com/greenwoodpages/greenwoodmain.html">"Map of London ... from an Actual Survey made in the years 1824, 1825 and 1826"</a> reveals in the <a href="http://www.oldlondonmaps.com/greenwoodpages/greenwoodnorth18a.html">"Detail of area south of Westbourne Green and north of Hyde Park"</a> further developments on Cravenhill Lane</td></tr>  <tr><td style="padding-top: 1em"><img class="lpadding" src="/_assets/map-1889-london-poverty-booth-snip.jpg" border="0" alt="Extract from Booth's 'Poverty Map of London' (1889)" vspace="5" width="300" align="right" />Charles Booth's <a href="http://www.umich.edu/%7Erisotto/imagemap.html">"Poverty Map of London"</a> published in 1889 clearly shows that the <a href="http://www.umich.edu/%7Erisotto/maxzooms/nw/nwb56.html">streets of and around Craven Hill Gardens</a> are coloured green for "Upper-middle and Upper classes. Wealthy".</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>   <p>Through the 20th century, the area seems to have been much the same as it is today, with a mix of homes (whether lived-in or short-term leased) and hotels. There are contrasts, such as the cheap backpacker accommodation on one side of the square to the fabulously upmarket Hempel Hotel on the other. In general, the recent trend in the 21st century, occurring broadly across the Bayswater and Paddington area, is a move upmarket - the construction of The Lancasters is a clear indication of this. The tone of the area will continue to improve as the northern side of Hyde Park chases the demand and stature of the southern, eastern and western sides.</p><h2>Historical Plaques<a name="historical-plaques" title="historical-plaques"></a></h2><p>Historical plaques (whether blue, green or otherwise) can be found in the area around Craven Hill Gardens, denoting a place of historical significance.
